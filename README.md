# Enhanced Reading Google Chrome Extension

This project was presented as the final project for the Software Design and Development course at Carthage College in Fall 2017. We were given no guidelines on what to create or how to create it except that we had two weeks to work.

We started by identifying a problem with how hard it was to read on websites that were littered with ads and auto playing videos. We set out to create a Chrome extension that would allow us to read the text on a website without needing to worry about these distractions or slowdowns.

This extension, when enabled, highlights HTML containers the user mouses over to show which text the extension would use. When the user selects a container, everything but the text is removed and loaded into another tab for reading; allowing the user to either navigate away or close out the slow/annoying website. The user can change a variety of settings to more easily read the text and even grants a way to speed read through the text.

This was our first experience with creating an HTML/JS application. So while the project would benefit from refactoring, it is interesting to compare how far I have come in writing web apps.
